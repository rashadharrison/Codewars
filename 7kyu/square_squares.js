/*Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.*/

const isSquare = n => (Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0 ? true : false);
